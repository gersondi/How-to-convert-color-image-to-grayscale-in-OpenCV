## Image Processing Tutorials using OpenCV 

Welcome to the amazing universe of image processing.
Learn with me as I proceed from the basics of image processing using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).


#### NOTE: These tutorials are still in development.

#### Converting colour images to gray scale using OpenCv and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) 
##### Reading an image 
The function **cv2.imread()** to read an image. It takes two arguments 

```cv.imread("image_name",X)```

where X==1  -->  Loads a color image
where X==0  -->  Loads image in grayscale mode
where X==-1 -->  Loads image as such including alpha channel

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gersondi/gerson-dias.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
